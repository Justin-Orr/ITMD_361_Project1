      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is to do photography. I started back in highschool during my sophomore year and put in a recorded 1,500 hours of
        work for the school. I use a Nikon 3500 DSLR with a 70-200mm lens. I love talking about camera quality and capabilities and am always open to
        learning about new camera techniques.

      <h2>Camping</h2>
      <p>
        Camping is a great way to disconnect from so much going on with the world to enjoy spending time with friends and family. I like to kayak down
        rivers to feel the breeze and see people's crazy boats.
