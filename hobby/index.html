        One of my favorite hobbies is to do photography. I started back in highschool during my sophomore year and put in a recorded 1,500 hours of
        work for the school. I use a Nikon 3500 DSLR with a 70-200mm lens. I love talking about camera quality and capabilities and am always open to
        learning about new camera techniques.
