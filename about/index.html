      <p>
        I was born in Flint Michigan and lived my grandmother for some time. Then at the age of 3 I moved to Park Forest Illinois to live with my dad
        along with my older brother Robert. Park Forest and Chicago Heights is where I spent my childhood and built my relationships with my dad's
        side of the family. I attended Wilson Elementary then moved on to Bloom Township Highschool at the age of 15. After finishing my first year
        there I was accepted into the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora Illinois and finished my highschool education there. Moving
        forward from IMSA I attended the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago Illinois studying Computer Engineer. Midway through I switched
        to Computer Science and here I am now in my last semester looking to graduate this winter 2020.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is to do photography. I started back in highschool during my sophomore year and put in a recorded 1,500 hours of
        work for the school. I use a Nikon 3500 DSLR with a 70-200mm lens. I love talking about camera quality and capabilities and am always open to
        learning about new camera techniques. I am coffee enthusiast and love to see coffee being made. However, the way I drink my coffee does not
        match my love for it. I drink it black with no extra ingredients. I love to play video games and watch fantasy based shows. One other hobby,
        which has flooded my youtube reccomendations recently, is woodworking and DIY projects. Finally, camping is becoming one of my new interests
        and love to hear about cool things you can do while camping.
